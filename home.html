                        Tea is a soothing and sweet tea made to soak the Camellia sinensis leaves in hot water. Believed to have been discovered by Chinese sage / emperor Shennong in 2737 BCE, tea is after water the world's second most consumed beverage.
                    
                        Around 75 percent of all tea produced in this world is black tea, 20 percent is green and oolongs, whites and yellow tea account for the remainder. Tisanes or herbal infusions, such as rooibos tea, mate, rose hip tea and chamomile tea, have also become popular in the global tea culture, as well.However, it is important to remember that these infusions are not tea, because they do not contain traces of the leaves of Camellia sinensis.
                    
                        Tea is a rich xenobiotic source, a family of secondary metabolites. These metabolites are found in tea plants for their natural protection, but they are metabolized alongside water-soluble compounds when ingested as part of the dietary intake. This is also why it participates in fitness and wellbeing discussions.
                    
                        The tea world is as vast as it's deep. It comes with tradition-because of that, battles were waged-and legacy. It is a cocktail that all of us turn to at different times of the day. Our reasons for choosing tea are so many, welcome on a tea trip. Glad sipping!
