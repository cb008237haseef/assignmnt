            <div class="text-holder">
                <p>Tea grades are used to describe the form and design of the dried tea leaf. Grading is performed on the basis of the size of the leaf, the form of leaves used in the tea blend, the shine or bloom on the leaves, the scent, taste and color of the liquor and other such criteria. Tea is graded to help recognize its consistency and to determine its economic worth. The highest grades of tea are "orange pekoe" and consist of young shoots, while the lowest grades are called "fannings" and "dust".Different countries producing tea use different grading schemes. The most commonly used scheme is for teas from India , Sri Lanka, Africa, Indonesia , Malaysia, etc., while countries such as China, Japan , Vietnam, and South Korea have their own grading systems in place. Indian tea grades refer to black teas and certain green teas.</p>
                <p>Whole leaves offer more aromatic flavors, particularly when buds and tips are included in the composition. The split leaves and the fannings bring more strength and brittleness to the cup. As a result, entire leaves are more costly.</p>
